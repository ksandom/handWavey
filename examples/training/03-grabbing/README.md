# handWavey Training - Segments

So the last session was about segments, which are a representation of how twisted your wrist is.

The other component to gestures in handWavey is grabbing, which is simply opening and closing your hand.

This training is in the format of an [example configuration](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/blob/main/docs/user/exampleConfigurations.md) that you can apply. It intentionally does not perform any actions like mouse clicks, or key presses. This way you can experiment freely and get comfortable with it in a relaxed setting.

## Exercise - Playing with grabbing

1. Start by placing your hand about 30cm above the sensor. The mouse cursor should be moving with your hand.
1. Open and close your hand. Things to notice:
    * You should hear a _donk_ noise every time you close your hand.
    * Notice that you don't have to close your hand the whole way. In fact you'll probably find that it's more relaxing not to. Just make sure you go far enough that you confidently hit it each time.

### Explaining grabbing

There's not much to explain with this one.
