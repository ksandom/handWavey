# Training

Over the time that I've been testing handWavey with different audiences; there has been a consistent problem where there are simply a few too many things to learn at once, which has ended up in the person getting discouraged and giving up. Fortunately, this is really easy to solve.

This training splits up the concepts you need to master so that you can easily learn them one by one, and work up at your own pace.

handWavey is ambidextrous; **you can use which ever hand you prefer** without needing to make any configuration changes.

## Stages

Each of these stages are fully self-contained [configuration examples](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/blob/main/docs/user/exampleConfigurations.md) so you can return to them in any order, at any time. Although I recommend going through them in order on your first time around.

1. [Basics](00-basics). - Learn how to confidently activate and deactivate movement of the mouse. And while you're there, you can get a feel for how to move the mouse.
1. [Accuracy and healthy usage](01-accuracy). - Learn how to confidently and **comfortably** be more accurate.
1. [Segments](02-segments). - Learn how to trigger the segments that you want. These form part of the gestures that you will perform.
1. [Grabbing](03-grabing). - Learn how to trigger the open and closed states by grabbing with your hand. These form the other major part of performing gestures.
1. [Putting it together](04-allTogether). - Let's start making some gestures.
1. TODO 05-2Hands. - Learn how to use both hands to unlock more power, or accessibility possibilities.
1. Now you're ready to
    * apply a [gestureLayout](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/tree/main/examples/gestureLayouts) that suits you. I recommend [tiltClick/actionModifier](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/tree/main/examples/gestureLayouts/tiltClick/actionModifier).
    * change the [audio notifications](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/tree/main/examples/audio) to suit your preferences. Although I recommend keeping them on while you get comfortable with it.

## Other needs

There are various accessibility related configurations that may be of interest to you. You can read more about those in the [accessibility documentation](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/blob/main/docs/user/accessibility.md).

Also check out the rest of the [example configurations](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/tree/main/examples). handWavey is extremely configurable. If there's something you need to solve, there's probably a way to do it already, and maybe even an example to get you going faster.

## Further reading

There's lots of [documentation](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/tree/main/docs) to help you get the most out of handWavey. In particular the [getting started](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/blob/main/docs/user/gettingStarted.md) documentation is well worth a read.
