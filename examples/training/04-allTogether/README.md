# handWavey Training - All together

Let's perform some gestures!

This training is in the format of an [example configuration](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/blob/main/docs/user/exampleConfigurations.md) that you can apply. It intentionally does not perform any actions like mouse clicks, or key presses. This way you can experiment freely and get comfortable with it in a relaxed setting.

## Exercise - Achieving the gestures that you want.

1. Start by placing your hand about 30cm above the sensor. The mouse cursor should be moving with your hand.
1. Choose a segment that you want to select. Things to notice:
    * You should hear the piano note as you hit that segment.
1. Close your hand. Things to notice:
    * You should hear the _donk_ as you close your hand.
    * You should hear the same piano note.
1. Open your hand. Things to notice:
    * You should hear the _donk_ as you open your hand.
    * You should hear the same piano note.

Now. Let's do it the other way around.

1. Start by placing your hand about 30cm above the sensor. The mouse cursor should be moving with your hand.
1. Close your hand. Things to notice:
    * You should hear the _donk_ as you close your hand.
    * You should hear the same piano note.
1. Choose a segment that you want to want. Things to notice:
    * You should hear the piano note as you hit that segment.
1. Return your segment back to a neutral position. Things to notice:
    * You should hear the piano note(s) as you return.
1. Open your hand. Things to notice:
    * You should hear the _donk_ as you open your hand.
    * You should hear the same piano note.

Try repeating each motion until you can reliably hear the same note while opening and closing your hand.

### Explaining combining gestures

This exercise really highlights if you are not being quite accurate enough. So if you're ever in doubt, this is an excellent exercise to come back to practise.

## Exercise - Achieving the gestures with a steady mouse cursor

1. Choose a point on your desktop, and imagine that you want to click that.
1. Start by placing your hand about 30cm above the sensor. The mouse cursor should be moving with your hand.
1. Move your hand to get the cursor over that spot.
1. Now try practicing performing a gesture on that spot. In particular:
    * Closing and opening your hand. Things to note:
        * This will not stabilise the mouse cursor, so you may notice a wobble.
    * Choosing a different segment, and returning. Things to note:
        * The mouse cursor should move very slightly, but will be rock solid for a moment.

Try repeating this exercise until you are confident that you can perform the gesture on the target that you want.

### Explaining the mouse cursor

When you are able to confidently hit the target, this is when you will get much better at using handWavey.
