# shakeyHands

The shakeyHands examples work by increasing the moving means where ever possible. This can reduce how much the shake gets through to the mouse cursor/scrolling, and gives the user more precision, but comes at the cost of responsiveness.

Most people have slightly shakey hands, and will be adequately served by the default config. But if you find it hard to keep your hand steady, then it is time to look at these examples to find what is best for you.

If you decide to use one of these, you **will** need to tweak them to your needs. I've made several assumptions, and they will be wrong for you. But will hopefully give you a head start to improving the usability of your computer.
