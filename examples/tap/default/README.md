# tap - default

This is the default configuration at the time of this writing. I've found it to be a nice balance between unwanted events, and ease of triggering the events.

It's possible that this example might not always get updates at the default evolves. The easiest to be sure that you have the latest default is to delete `tap.yml` in [your configuration directory](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/blob/main/docs/user/configuration/whereIsMyConfigurationDirectory.md).
