  tapSpeed:
    description: The speed of the Z axis (away from you), above which, the hand is
      considered to be performing a tap. Setting this to -1 disables the tap gesture.
      You'll need tapSpeed to be set to something positive for this to work. I suggest
      starting around 5-10.
    value: '5'
