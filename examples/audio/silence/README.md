# Silence

This turns off all audio feedback. I highly recommend using the nothing example instead so that you get assistance when new features are added. But if you simply want everything to shut up, this is an effective way of doing that.

It's also important to still receive the bug notification, because that tells you when something is crashing, and will help you understand why so that you can fix it. This is rare these days, but still valuable.
