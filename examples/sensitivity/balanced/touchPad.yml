  accelerationThreshold:
    description: 'Decimal: The speed that the hand must move faster than for acceleration
      to apply.'
    value: '8'
  unAcceleratedBaseMultiplier:
    description: 'Decimal: How much to speed up unaccelerated movement. 1 is no change,
      0.5 is half as fast, 2 is twice as fast. Think of this as how fast you want
      to cursor to move normally.'
    value: '2'
  acceleratedBaseMultiplier:
    description: 'Decimal: How much to speed up accelerated movement. 1 is no change,
      0.5 is half as fast, 2 is twice as fast. Think of this as how fast you want
      to cursor to move when acceleration is active.'
    value: '2'
  maxSpeed:
    description: Maximum speed per second.
    value: '500'
  accelerationExponent:
    description: 'Decimal: How much to increase the power of the acceleration. 1 is
      no change, 0.5 is half as fast, 2 is twice as fast. Think of this as how power
      the acceleration is.'
    value: '1.2'
