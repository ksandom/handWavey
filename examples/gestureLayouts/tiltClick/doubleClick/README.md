    * Double click:

      * Hand in neutral position. Close your hand. Rotate slightly unnaturally.
    * Tripple click: Tap with closed hand (like a slight punching motion.)
* Scroll: Hand in neutral position. Close your hand. Move hand up/down.

    * ALT: Introduce secondary hard. Keep relatively flat.
    * Shift: Introduce secondary hard. Tilt in natural direction to almost vertical.

## Considerations

* Dragging over larger areas is currently unreliable.

## Target audience

Most people?

This is meant to

* be easier to click repetitively with less impact on your wrist.
* be a more relax way to hold your hand.
