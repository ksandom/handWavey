## Solutions

* Shakey hands? - The [shakeyHands configuration examples](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/tree/main/examples/shakeyHands) reduce the amount of shake coming from your hands. [See shakeyHands in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzjE0iBb5lE).
* Reduced mobility in your hands? - The [reducedMobility configuration examples](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/tree/main/examples/gestureLayouts/reducedMobility) give you the same power by using one arm to control the cursor, and the other arm to specify what actions are doing. [See reducedMobility in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeJR2K5a2fA).
* Sensitivity. - Control how quickly the mouse cursor moves with a given amount of hand movement using the [sensitivity configuration examples](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/tree/main/examples/sensitivity).  This is more general, but also belongs in this list.
