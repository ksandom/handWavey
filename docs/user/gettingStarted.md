# Getting started

handWavey is not hard to use, but it is optimised for long term comfort, flexibility, and power. As such it can be a little daunting to get started. Here are some resources to get you started:

* [handWavey - getting started](https://www.randomksandom.com/handWavey-gettingStarted/). - My blog post covering:
    * What it is.
    * Some things to get right while setting up the device.
    * Various new features since the [main video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCbar8w3Pws), especially for accessibility.
* [Training](https://github.com/ksandom/handWavey/tree/main/examples/training) configurations. - Some configurations that you can apply to help you master the different concepts in a relaxed way.
* [Accessibility](accessibility.md) - Where to find accessibility oriented documentation and configuration examples to help you get the most out of handWavey.
